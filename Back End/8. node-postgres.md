## 2. Connection setup

Run `npm install pg` to install `node-postgres`.

The `node-postgres` connection can be configured within a `db` directory, alongside the SQL seeding script for the database that is to be connected to.

```
 └── node_modules/
 └── db/
 │  ├──── index.js <-- node-postgres connection pool
 │  └──── seed.sql
 ├── .gitignore
 ├── package-lock.json
 └── package.json
```

### Connecting with a single Client

A connection to a psql database is made by creating a new instance of the node-postgres `Client` class:

```js
// db/index.js
const { Client } = require("pg");

const client = new Client();

client
  .connect()
  .then(() => {
    console.log(`connected to ${process.env.PGDATABASE}!`);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log("connection error:", err);
  });
```

The database connection settings can be set using [environment variables](https://node-postgres.com/features/connecting#environment-variables):

```sh
PGDATABASE=my_database_name node db/index.js
```

Accepted environment variables include `PGDATABASE`, `PGUSER`,`PGPASSWORD`, `PGHOST`, & `PGPORT`.

**If no PGDATABASE environment variable is set, node-postgres will connect to the default database.**

### Connection Pooling

Connecting a new client to a PostgreSQL server can take 20-30 milliseconds. During this time passwords are negotiated, SSL may be established, and configuration information is shared between the client and the server. Incurring this cost every time an application wants to execute a query would substantially slow it down.

When working with web applications, or other software that makes frequent queries to a database, connection pools can be used.

A client pool allows the app to have a reusable pool of clients that can be checked-out, used, and returned. Generally an app will want a limited number of these (usually just 1), as creating an unbounded number of pools defeats the purpose of pooling at all.

[Connection pooling](https://node-postgres.com/apis/pool) with `node-postgres` follows a similar syntax to connecting with a single client, and uses the same queries api, but has some additional [config options and methods](https://node-postgres.com/apis/pool).

When there is only a single query that needs to be run on the database, the pool has a method to run a query on the first available idle client and return its result using [pool.query()](https://node-postgres.com/apis/pool#poolquery).

```js
// db/index.js
const { Pool } = require("pg");

const db = new Pool();
```

We can prevent accidental connections to the default database by checking that a database name is provided to the environment variables. It's usually useful to export the connection pool so that database queries can be run in different files:

```js
// db/index.js
const { Pool } = require("pg");

if (!process.env.PGDATABASE) {
  throw new Error("No PGDATABASE configured");
}

module.exports = new Pool();
```

### Queries

The api for executing queries supports both callbacks and promises.

Below is an example using promises:

```js
const db = new Pool();

db.query("SELECT * FROM table_name;")
  .then((result) => console.log(result))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```

The [results object](https://node-postgres.com/apis/result) that is returned by `node-postgres` for a successful query has a key of `rows` which is an array of the records that have been returned by the query in the form of a json-like object for each row.

## 3. Using `node-postgres` with `express` example

### GET example

#### Express app setup

Install `express`.

Setup `app.js` and `snacks.js` controllers:

```js
// app.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const { sendSnacks } = require('./controllers/snacks.js');

app.get('/api/snacks', sendSnacks);

module.exports = app;
∏
// controllers/snacks.js
exports.sendSnacks = (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send('GET all snacks route OK.');
};
```

#### Accessing and sending data from the database

Each controller should be responsible for invoking a model that will provide data in the format that is to be sent to the client.

As such, it is the model function that will need to use the `client` that is exported from `db/index.js` to query the database.

```js
// models/snacks.js
const db = require("../db/index.js");

exports.selectSnacks = () => {
  return db.query("SELECT * FROM snacks;").then((result) => result.rows);
};
```

The model function must `return` the query so that the result can be accessed in the `.then()` block when the model is invoked in the controller function.

By returning `result.rows` from the query, the data is sent to the controller function as an array, ready to be sent to the client. Making the controller function extremely succinct.

```js
// controllers/snacks.js
const { selectSnacks } = require("../models/snacks.js");

exports.sendSnacks = (req, res) => {
  selectSnacks().then((snacks) => res.status(200).send({ snacks }));
};
```

## 4. `node-postgres` parameterized query examples

### GET by ID example

For a request to `GET` a specific snack from the database, the endpoint could be set up as follows:

#### Route and Controller Setup

```js
// app.js
app.get("/api/snacks/:snack_id").get(sendSnackById);

// controllers/snacks.js
exports.sendSnackById = (req, res) => {
  const { snack_id } = req.params;
  selectSnackById(snack_id).then((snack) => res.status(200).send({ snack }));
};
```

#### Model Setup

For an endpoint that uses values from the request object, such as `params`, `query` or `body`, **string concatenation and string template literals should NOT be used.**

This can (and often does) lead to _**sql injection**_ vulnerabilities. This means that external code, written by the client, could be run on the database server, potentially giving access to read, write and modify sensitive data (e.g. passwords, email addresses, personal data, etc.)

The model function in this case would then need to use the `snack_id` parameter in the SQL query,.

Without having to use a template literal, or string concatenation, the query method accepts a second argument of an array of values.

The indexes of the array can then be accessed in the raw sql query by using `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, etc... depending on the variables position in the array.

```js
// models/snacks.js
exports.selectSnackById = (snack_id) => {
  return db
    .query("SELECT * FROM snacks WHERE snack_id = $1;", [snack_id])
    .then((result) => result.rows[0]);
};
```

The above query returns an array containing a single object for the returned row.

The resulting row should be destructured before being returned to the controller. This is because the model in the MVC framework should be responsible for both fetching and formatting the data ready for the controller to send to the client.

### POST example

For a request to `POST` a new snack to the database, the endpoint could be set up as follows.

#### Route Setup

The `.post()` method can be added to the existing routes in `app.js`

```js
// app.js
app.post("/api/snacks", addSnack);
```

#### Controller Setup

The controller is then responsible for passing the request body to the model, and sending the newly inserted snack to the client.

```js
// controllers/snacks.js
exports.addSnack = (req, res) => {
  insertSnack(req.body).then((snack) => res.status(201).send({ snack }));
};
```

#### Model Setup

Within the model, the key values for the data that is being inserted can be destructured from the body that has been sent, and passed into the array that `.query()` accepts as its second argument.

`'...RETURNING *;'` must be added to the end of the `'INSERT INTO...'` SQL statement in order for the newly inserted row to be returned by the query.

```js
// model/snacks.js
exports.insertSnack = (newSnack) => {
  const { snack_name, price, flavour_text } = newSnack;
  return db
    .query(
      "INSERT INTO snacks (snack_name, price, flavour_text) VALUES ($1, $2, $3) RETURNING *;",
      [snack_name, price, flavour_text]
    )
    .then(({ rows }) => rows[0]);
};
```
